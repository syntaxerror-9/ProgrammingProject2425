You're a player in a video game. You will be presented with the board.
Every unit is composed of two numbers: the first will signal it's type, for example:
(1) = Butterfly, (2) = Fairy, (3) = Unicorn, (4) = Wall.
Each unit has different stats:
* Butterfly: HP ($1) ATTACK ($2) ATTACK COUNTDOWN ($3)
* Fairy: HP ($4) ATTACK ($5) ATTACK COUNTDOWN ($6)
* Unicorn: HP ($7) ATTACK ($8) ATTACK COUNTDOWN ($9)
* Wall: HP ($10)

The second number will be its color:
(1) Blue, (2) Red, (3) Yellow

For example:
(1-1) = Blue Butterfly, (2-3) = Yellow Fairy

Every unit except the wall has a color property.

You can choose to move a unit from one column to another column. Moving to the same column is not allowed.
You can delete a unit in any row of any column.
Whenever a unit dies, it will be added to the reinforcement count.

To create an attack formation, you need to have 3 units of the same type and of the same colors adjacent.
E.g.
  -   (1-1)(3-3)  -    -
  -   (2-1)  -    -    -
  -   (2-1)  -    -    -
  -   (2-1)  -    -    -


(Note: the empty spaces are "-")

This will create an attack formation of Fairys and move to the front rows of the column.
When an attack formation is created it will begin charging it's attack and after the attack countdown period has passed
it will attack the enemy board. The enemy board can defend with units of their own, however if there are not
enough units to defend the enemy's hero will take damage. If the enemy's hero health is below 1 you win.

When you create a defensive formation, the units will transform into walls

E.g.

-  (1-1)(1-1)(1-1)  -
-    -    -    -    -
-    -    -    -    -
-    -    -    -    -

This will transform the blue unicorns in walls (4)

You will be provided first with your board, then with the enemy board, how many reinforcements you have, how many turns
you have left and the health of each hero.
